# ProjectConnect App

Refer to [unicef/projectconnect-app](https://github.com/unicef/projectconnect-app) for an overview.

## üõ† Architecture

This webapp is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a React Framework and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

- `pages/_app.js` is the application entry point:
  1. Imports the default Bootstrap stylesheet, and additional styles found in `styles/global.css`
  2. Wraps the application in a `<CookieProvider>` to make available [react-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie) throughout the code.
- `pages/index.js` is the first page to load, which imports `components/intro.js`:
  1. Landing page includes static content
  2. links to `pages/start-test.js` and `pages/tips.js`
  3. Includes FAQ as a Bootstrap accordion.
- `pages/tips.js` is primarily static content, pulling images from `public/tips/`
- `pages/start-test.js` is also mostly static content that directs users to `pages/test.js` or `pages/mapping.js`
- `pages/mapping.js` contains most of the logic for the application:
  1. Fetches dataset of schools to validate from API endpoint: `pages/api/getLocations/[uuid].js`
  2. Sets cookie, and adds user to Database (`pages/api/addUser.js`), if cookie is not set
  3. Presents data through frontend, by calling `components/quiz.js
  4. Stores user response through API endpoint: `pages/api/validateLocation.js`
  5. Upon completion, redirects user to `components/result.js`
- `pages/test.js` is a simplified version of `pages/mapping.js` that instead of pulling data from the database, it pulls local data from `pages/api/quizQuestions.js` and does not store any of the user answers. It calls `components/quizTest.js`, analogous to `components/quiz.js`
- `components/quiz.js` iterates through the dataset prompting the user to respond to each location. It calls the `component/mapComponent.js` to render the actual map using Mapbox as the provider through [react-mapbox-gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mapbox-gl) as bindings for [mapbox-gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)

## üëä Launching a New Campaign

When adding a new campaign for a partner, edit [constants/index.js](constants/index.js) and add a new entry in the dictionary, specifying all three fields, namely:

- `name`: The name of the partner or campaign
- `users`: The targeted number of users to register and participate throughout the campaign
- `taggings`: The targeted number of location taggings that the campaign aims to reach

## ‚úèÔ∏è Configuration

In order to run this application, you need to set up a [Postgres Database](https://www.postgresql.org/) and open an account with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to obtain an _Access Token_. The following [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) need to be set in `.env` or `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN="MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"
PGUSER="POSTGRES_USER"
PGHOST="POSTGRES_HOST"
PGPASSWORD="POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
PGDATABASE="POSTGRES_DATABASE"
```

To work with the authentication functionalities, you need to add the following entries to the `.env` or `.env.local`:

```
SECRET="A secret to use for key generation"
NEXTAUTH_URL="HOST_URL"
FACEBOOK_ID="YOUR_FACEBOOK_ID"
FACEBOOK_SECRET="YOUR_FACEBOOK_SECRET"
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID"
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_CALLBACK="HOST_URL"
```

To obtain the secrets, contact one of the contributors.

The [countries.json](data/countries.json) is included in this repository to associate country codes with country names. If this file needs to be updated or replaced, follow these instructions:

1. Download [the JSON file of country names and ISO-3166 alpha-2 codes here](https://datahub.io/core/country-list) from Data Hub. Place the JSON file in `scripts/` of this repository and call it `countryCodes.json`.
2. From the root directory, run `node scripts/createCountryCodesJson.js` to run the script that creates the JSON file the game requires and places it in `data/`.
3. Verify that the JSON file `countries.json` exists inside `data/` and it is in the format:

```
{
    "Country code": "Country name",
    ...
}
```

## üíª Development Environment

Setup your development environment as follows:

1. Clone this repo:
   - SSL:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lacabra/proco-map-app.git
   ```
   - HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lacabra/proco-map-app.git
   ```
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd proco-map-app
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your local [Postgres Database](https://www.postgresql.org/) and configure the following environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   PGUSER=
   PGHOST=
   PGPASSWORD=
   PGDATABASE=
   ```
4. Open an account with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to obtain an _Access Token_. Add your access token to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   ```
5. Optional: If you need to test the user authentication, you will need to set up your own credentials with either one of the OAuth providers:
   - RECOMENDED FOR EASIER SETUP: **GitHub**: Follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
     - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
     - Authorization Callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
6. Optional: you may get a [_jwt_auto_generated_signing_key_ warning](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/484) that you can resolve by following the instructions on that link, or [these instructions](https://next-auth.js.org/warnings).
7. Run the developmnet server with [fast refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üóÑ Data Ingestion

This application expects a CSV file containing the following data about each school:

- lat
- lon
- id
- country

Name the file `schools.csv` and copy it into the `scripts/` folder. In that folder run:

```bash
node csvToJson.js
```

The above script will generate a file `schools.json` that will be ingested by `db/dbOps.js`.

_Note: For testing purposes a sample `scripts/schools.json` is included in the code repository, which has the same data as the locations used in the [practice test](https://github.com/lacabra/proco-map-app/blob/master/pages/api/getLocationsTest.js), yet in production a different dataset will be used._
