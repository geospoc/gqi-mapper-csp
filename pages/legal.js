        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          This privacy statement describes Project Connect’s policy concerning the
          gathering and sharing of visitors’ information through the Project Connect Web
          Application (webapp), located at{" "}
          <a href="https://game.projectconnect.world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://game.projectconnect.world
          </a>
          .&nbsp; By using the Project Connect webapp you are accepting the practices
          described in this policy.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4>What information does Project Connect collect?</h4>

        <h5>Normal website usage</h5>

        <p>
          In general, you can browse the Project Connect webapp without telling us who you
          are or revealing any personal information about yourself.&nbsp; The only
          information we gather during general browsing is from standard server
          logs.&nbsp; These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name,
          browser type, operating system, and information such as the web site that
          referred you to us, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits.
        </p>

        <h5>Collection of personally identifiable information</h5>

        <p>We are not collecting any personal data.</p>

        <h5>Security</h5>

        <p>
          We do not sell or share any personally identifiable information volunteered on
          the Project Connect site to any third party without prior consent.&nbsp; Any
          information provided to Project Connect by users of the Project Connect&apos;s
          webapp is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways
          other than as set forth in this privacy policy, or in ways to which you have
          explicitly consented.&nbsp; Project Connect employs a range of techniques and
          security measures to protect the information maintained on our system from loss,
          misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, Project Connect assumes no responsibility for the security of
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Project Connect&apos;s webapp contains links to sites external to the
          projectconnect.world domain. Project Connect is not responsible for the privacy

        <h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>

        <p>

          schools or hospitals identified.

        <h3 className="text-align-center">Cookies policy</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          By visiting or using this web application (webapp), a cookie will be created
          which Project Connect may use to provide statistics that help us to give you the
          best experience of our sites. The statement below describes our policy on
          cookies.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not agree with any of the following, you can switch off the cookies.
          However, by continuing to use our sites without changing settings, you are
          agreeing to our use of cookies.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>

        <p>
          During the course of any visit to our websites, the pages which you see, along
          with something called a cookie, are downloaded to your computer. Most, if not
          all, websites do this, and that’s because cookies allow the website publisher to
          do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has
          visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and
          finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          So – what is a cookie? When you enter a site your computer will automatically be
          issued with a cookie. Cookies are text files which identify your computer to our
          server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the
          computer used. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their site, in order to
          track traffic flows. Cookies themselves only record which areas of the site have
          been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the
          opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a
          cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time, although this of course
          means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user.
          You should read the information that came with your browser software to see how
          you can do this. Even assuming you have not set your computer to reject cookies,
          you can browse our sites anonymously until such time as you register your
          information with Project Connect.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>What do cookies tell us?</h5>

        <p>
          We use cookies to collect data for analytics, such as demographic and interest
          data, based on your browsing patterns. This data allows us to estimate your age
          range, your gender and things that might interest you.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>What do we use cookies for?</h5>

        <p>
          We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you return to
          our websites. In particular, we use cookies to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            better understand our audience and supporters, for example by estimating our
            audience size and patterns and tracking the level of interest in our
            campaigns;
          </li>
          <li>
            track your preferences and personalise the sites to your requirements and
            interests;
          </li>
          <li>avoid lengthy registration/personalisation on each visit;</li>
          <li>improve and update our websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>How do we collect and analyze cookies?</h5>

        <p>
          Project Connect does not collect and analyze the data to create cookies
          directly; we use a specialist service provider which both collects information
          on your preferences from your visits to our websites and analyzes your
          preferences from cookies already stored in your browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          We obtain this information by enabling Google Analytics to analyze the traffic
          on our websites via &quot;Google Advertising Cookies&quot;. Google Advertising
          Cookies are a series of cookies already stored in your browser that compile data
          from your browsing preferences. You can see the types of cookies used by Google
          and learn more about the different categories in the&nbsp;

            Google privacy &amp; terms
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          We may change our specialist service provider at any time without notice to you
          and will update this Policy as necessary at that time.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>What can you do if you do not want us to use your cookies?</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Configure how we use your&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Analytics information</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you would like to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking services then
            you can install an Add-on.&nbsp;

          <li>
            Alternatively, you can use your browsers’ private browsing mode. Common
            browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, Safari and Internet Explorer have this
            functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
          How do I opt-out of the collection and use of information for promotional
          purposes generally?
        </h5>

        <p>
          There are many websites that provide guidance on how to opt out of the
          collection and use of your information for promotional purposes that are not
          limited to Project Connect web properties. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads settings</a>

        <h5>Do you share data from cookies with other organizations?</h5>

        <p>
          We do not sell or share any data from your cookies to any third party without
          prior consent.
